**Abstract.** Extending the knowledge of a model is an open problem in deep learning. A central issue in incremental learning is catastrophic forgetting, resulting in degradation of previous knowledge when gradually learning new information.
The scope of the described implementation is to reproduce some existing baselines that address the difficulties posed by incremental learning, to propose variations to the existing frameworks in order to gain a deeper knowledge of their components and in-depth insights, and finally to define new approaches to overcome existing limitations.
